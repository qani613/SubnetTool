# Network Tool

This Python script is a versatile network tool that provides various functionalities for network administrators. It includes subnetting, decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal conversion, subnet and host calculations, reverse DNS lookup, IP address geolocation, and network port scanning.

## Functionalities

1. **Subnetting**: Perform subnetting calculations to divide an IP network into multiple subnets with custom subnet masks.

2. **Decimal to Binary**: Convert decimal numbers to binary representation.

3. **Binary to Decimal**: Convert binary numbers to decimal representation.

4. **Calculate Subnets and Hosts**: Calculate the number of subnets and hosts per subnet based on a given subnet mask.

5. **Reverse DNS Lookup**: Retrieve the domain name associated with a given IP address.

6. **IP Address Geolocation**: Fetch geolocation data for an IP address, including country, city, organization, ISP, and time zone information.

7. **Network Port Scanning**: Scan open ports on a specified IP address or range of IP addresses.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script `network_tool.py`.
3. Choose one of the available options by entering the corresponding number.
4. Follow the prompts and provide the required inputs as requested.
5. View the output and proceed to the next task or select a new option.

# SubnetTool

SubnetTool is a Python script that provides functionalities for subnetting, decimal to binary conversion, binary to decimal conversion, and calculating the number of subnets and hosts for a given subnet mask.

## Features

- Subnetting: Split a given network IP into multiple subnets with specified subnet masks.
- Decimal to Binary: Convert decimal numbers to binary representation.
- Binary to Decimal: Convert binary numbers to decimal representation.
- Calculate Subnets and Hosts: Determine the number of subnets and hosts that can be created for a given subnet mask.

## Usage

1. Subnetting: Enter the network IP, subnet mask, and the number of desired subnets. The script will calculate and display the subnet details for each subnet. You can also save the subnet details to a text file for future reference.

2. Decimal to Binary: Enter a decimal number. The script will convert it to binary and display the binary representation.

3. Binary to Decimal: Enter a binary number. The script will convert it to decimal and display the decimal representation.

4. Calculate Subnets and Hosts: Enter the subnet mask. The script will calculate and display the number of subnets and hosts that can be created with that subnet mask.

## Getting Started

To get started with SubnetTool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/qani613/network_tool.py`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NetworkTool`
3. Run the script: `network_tool.py`
