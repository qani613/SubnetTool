# SubnetTool

SubnetTool is a Python script that provides functionalities for subnetting, decimal to binary conversion, binary to decimal conversion, and calculating the number of subnets and hosts for a given subnet mask.

## Features

- Subnetting: Split a given network IP into multiple subnets with specified subnet masks.
- Decimal to Binary: Convert decimal numbers to binary representation.
- Binary to Decimal: Convert binary numbers to decimal representation.
- Calculate Subnets and Hosts: Determine the number of subnets and hosts that can be created for a given subnet mask.

## Usage

1. Subnetting: Enter the network IP, subnet mask, and the number of desired subnets. The script will calculate and display the subnet details for each subnet. You can also save the subnet details to a text file for future reference.

2. Decimal to Binary: Enter a decimal number. The script will convert it to binary and display the binary representation.

3. Binary to Decimal: Enter a binary number. The script will convert it to decimal and display the decimal representation.

4. Calculate Subnets and Hosts: Enter the subnet mask. The script will calculate and display the number of subnets and hosts that can be created with that subnet mask.
